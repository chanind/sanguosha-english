# sanguosha-english

This repo contains the code for [sanguosha.chanind.com](https://sanguosha.chanind.com). All content comes from [sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com](https://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/). I made this site back in 2011 to help me play Sanguosha (三国杀) with coworkers when I was doing an internship in Beijing. This site is a list of all the pictures of all the cards along with translations in English, so if there's a card you see that you don't understand you can find it on the website and click to see a translation.

I just found the code laying around and figured I'd put it in this repo for posterity.

Enjoy!
