If the total number of cards given away is 2 or more, the player regains 1 unit of health."},{"name":"Character ability 2: [Ruler Ability] \"Rouse 激将 (jī jiàng)\"","description":"As a RULER 主公, Liu Bei can ask any Shu 蜀 character that is in play to use an ATTACK 杀 card for him. The attack is considered as being \"used\" by Liu Bei even though the card itself comes from another player. This means the attack properties such as range and element is based on Liu Bei, not the player that issued the card. Of course, Shu characters in play can choose not to use an ATTACK card for him."}],"faq_text":"<br /><br />1. Can Liu Bei choose not to increase health after giving 2 cards or more?<br /> Ans: No. <br /><br />2. Can the receiving player refuse to accept the cards?<br /> Ans: No.''Rouse'' 1. If a Shu Character uses an ATTACK in response to Liu Bei's  ''Rouse'' who suffers the penalty of retaliation or receives the rewards for a kill? The Shu Character who used the ATTACK, or Liu Bei? Ans:  Liu Bei . He is the source of the attack and will receive all the penalties/rewards. 2. If no player responds, can Liu Bei still use an ATTACK card ? Ans: Yes if he has not used any ATTACK  prior to using ''Rouse''. <br /><br />3. If no player responds, can Liu Bei change a different target player and use ''Rouse'' again?<br /> Ans: Yes. <br /><br />4. If no player responds, can Liu Bei use ''Benovelence'' to give other players cards before using ''Rouse'' again?<br /> Ans: Yes. <br /><br />5. Is there a limit to the number of times this ability can be used in a turn?<br /> Ans: It depends. As long as an ATTACK card has not been used in Liu Bei's turn to attack another player, ''Rouse'' can be used repeatedly. <br /><br />6. Can the ATTACK used by a Shu Character (in response to ''Rouse'') carry that character's ability attributes?<br /> Eg. Can Ma Chao use ''Iron Calvary '' with his ATTACK? Ans: It depends on the ability. ''Rouse'' only allows the character to use ATTACK on behalf of Liu Bei. Guan Yu and Zhao Yun can use their abilities to produce an ATTACK card but Ma Chao's ''Iron Calvary'' ability occurs on top of producing the ATATCK card and is therefore not allowed . <br /><br />7. Can the Shu Character use his weapon attributes when he uses ATTACK?<br /> Ans: Only ''Serpent Halbert'' attribute is allowed since it only involves producing an ATTACK. All other weapon ability's that add-on to the ATTACK is not allowed. <br /><br />8. Will Liu Bei's weapon attributes be effective when another Shu Character responds to ''Rouse''?<br /> Ans: Yes, as long as it fullfils the ability criteria . Eg: ''Heaven Scorcher Halbert'' ability cannot be used since it is not Liu Bei's card that is used. <br /><br />9. If Liu Bei equipped ''Serpent Halbert'' , can a Shu Character use any 2 characters as an ATTACK?<br /> Ans: No. The ATTACK card needs to be produced by the character. Remember that producing the ATTACK card is not the same as the weapon ability. (I know its a little confusing) <br /><br />10. After a Shu Character uses ATTACK in response , can Liu Bei still use an ATTACK card himself  in that turn?<br /> Ans: No. The ATTACK card by the character is considered used on behalf on Liu Bei , so it counts as Liu Bei having already used an ATTACK card in his turn. <br /><br />11. Can Liu Bei give away the equipped cards?<br /> Ans: No. He can only give his on-hand cards.","link_references":[{"Gender Double Swords":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/gender-double-swords-ci-xiong-shuang-gu.html"},{"Zhu Ge Liang 诸葛亮's":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/younger-zhu-ge-liang.html"},{"Guan Yu 关羽":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/guan-yu.html"},{"Zhang Fei 张飞":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/zhang-fei.html"},{"Ma Chao":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/ma-chao.html"},{"Guan Yu ":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/guan-yu.html"},{"Zhao Yun":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/zhao-yun.html"},{"Serpent Halbert":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/serpent-halberd-zhang-ba-she-mao.html"},{"Heaven Scorcher Halbert":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/heaven-scorcher-halberd-fang-tian-hua.html"},{"Serpent Halbert":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/serpent-halberd-zhang-ba-she-mao.html"}],"kingdom":"Shu Characters 蜀将"},{"name":"Elder Zhū Gě Liàng 暮年诸葛亮","image_url":"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_cZXVdsBvjyM/THcMxfcZFSI/AAAAAAAAAQU/ql7Z-xGUgbw/s200/shualaozhuge.jpg","local_image":"shualaozhuge.jpg","card_url":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/elder-zhu-ge-liang.html","abilities":[{"name":"Character ability 1: \"Star Gazing 观星 (guān xīng)\"","description":"At the beginning of Zhu Ge Liang's turn, before any judgement or drawing of cards, he can view X number of cards from the top of the deck (X equals to the number of players still in play with X having maximum of 5).

Which comes first?<br /> \"Star Gazing\" ability or Judgement?Ans: The ability comes first. Therefore Zhu Ge Liang is able to manipulate the judgement card to his favor.<br /><br />2. Can he place all the cards that were gazed at the bottom of the deck, and not leave any at the top?<br />Ans: Yes.<br /><br />3. Can this ability still apply when it is a 1-on-1 situation?<br />Ans: Yes. He can still gaze 2 cards, rearrange them, or place them at the bottom if he chooses.Empty City1. When Zhu Ge Liang has no more on-hand cards, can he be targeted for Diao Chan 貂蝉's \"Seed of Animosity 离间\" ability?[Updated 2nd Feb 2011] Ans: No. He cannot be targeted for Duel even if it is Diao Chan's ability.2. During the midst of a DUEL, if Zhu Ge Liang runs out of on-hand cards, does the \"Empty City\" ability activate?Ans: No. \"Empty City\" means he cannot be the target of DUEL or ATTACK. During DUEL, the card has already been activated, thus the DUEL goes on even if Zhu Ge Liang has no more cards on-hand. If he is unable to produce another ATTACK in the midst of the DUEL, he receives damage.3. Does RAINING ARROWS 万箭齐发, BARBARIANS 南蛮入侵 or tool cards other than DUEL have an effect on Zhu Ge Liang when he has no on-hand cards?Ans: Yes. \"Empty City\" only prevents ATTACK and DUEL. Other tool cards are still effective.<br /><br />4. Say a player equips \"Green Dragon Crescent Blade 青龙偃月刀\" and attacks Zhu Ge Liang, who has only 1 DODGE on-hand. After 1 ATTACK, Zhu Ge Liang uses his DODGE and no longer has anymore on-hand cards, but the weapon ability states that another ATTACK can be use if the previous was dodged. So can the second ATTACK be used on Zhu Ge Liang?<br />Ans: No. A second ATTACK card is executed after Zhu Ge Liang has activated his \"Empty City\" ability, therefore Zhu Ge Liang cannot be targeted for the second attack.<br /><br />5. If he has no card in hand and has Rattan Armor equipped, is he completely immune to all damage?<br />Ans: No. If someone were to shackle him then channel damage across, his will still suffer damage<br /><br />6. Is it possible for Zhu Ge Liang to blacken all the cards at the bottom of the deck for Zhen Ji using his Star Gazing ability?<br />Ans: Yes it is. But you will need to consider number of players and characters that can increase draw rate(such as Guo Jia and Xun Yu). It is not easy, but possible.","link_references":[{"Liu Bei 刘备":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/liu-bei.html"},{"Si Ma Yi 司马懿":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/si-ma-yi.html"},{"Wei Yan 魏延":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/wei-yan.html"},{"Diao Chan 貂蝉's":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/diao-chan.html"},{"Duel":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/duel.html"},{"RAINING ARROWS 万箭齐发":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/raining-arrows.html"},{"BARBARIANS 南蛮入侵":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/barbarians.html"},{"Green Dragon Crescent Blade 青龙偃月刀":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/green-dragon-crescent-blade-qing-long.html"}],"kingdom":"Shu Characters 蜀将"},{"name":"Zhào Yún 赵云","image_url":"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_cZXVdsBvjyM/THcNAlr5QMI/AAAAAAAAAQc/vvhNJZTNyjM/s200/shuazhaoyun.jpg","local_image":"shuazhaoyun.jpg","card_url":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/zhao-yun.html","abilities":[{"name":"Character ability: \"Dragon Heart 龙胆 (lóng dǎn)\"","description":"All ATTACK 杀 and DODGE 闪 cards can be used interchangeably."}],"faq_text":"<br /><br />1.

Not only was she brave, she was also capable in combat and intelligent. Wife of the Barbarian King, Meng Huo 孟获, she led an army to invade Shu Han 蜀汉 after her husband was cowed by Zhu Ge Liang 诸葛亮's advancing troops. She did so well in battle, in fact, that she captured 2 of Shu Han's generals; Zhang Yi 张嶷 and Ma Zhong 马忠. Her next opponents were the highly decorated generals Zhao Yun 赵云, and Wei Yan 魏延. Both these generals fled without much of a fight, but Zhu Rong smelled a rat and did not give chase. She was no fool as Shu Han had a trap set for her indeed. Yet when Wei Yan turned back to hurl insults at her, her emotions got the better of her and she gave chase. She fell into Shu Han's trap and was captured.

Which means to say this player can attack more than once in that turn , with Godspeed 1 being the extra bonus attack. Godspeed 2:  skip action phase+ discard 1 equipment .

This also means that LIGHTNING will NEVER strike her since she is the one that conducts the judgement for LIGHTNING and it requires \"spades\" to strike. An additional bonus is that she has a stronger chance of overcoming ACEDIA since judgement card of \"spades\" will equal to \"hearts\". "}],"faq_text":"<br /><br />1. Who can Xiao Qiao deflect damage to?<br /> Ans: Xiao Qiao can deflect damage to anyone including the attacker. <br /><br />2. Since all spade cards count as hearts for Xiao Qiao , When she flips a judgement could Si Ma Yi substitute with a spade to hurt her?<br /> Ans: No it cannot hurt her even if the judgement card is changed. The reasoning is the same as Zhang Jiao's lightning strike: the judgement card is considered as flipped by Xiao Qiao . Even if it was changed, it is still viewed as Xiao Qiao's judgement card .Hence spades will be viewed as hearts even if changed by Si Ma Yi. <br /><br />3. If I equip Frost Blade  寒冰剑 and attack Xiao Qiao, what happens if she redirect the damage?<br /> Ans: You can choose not to deal with her damage , in which case she can no longer redirect the damage. She would thus be forced to discard cards . This is one of the critical ways to disarm her. The weapon (Frost blade) works very well against her. <br /><br />4. Who is the source of damage when it is passed on , Xiao Qiao or the player who dealt damage to her?<br /> Ans: The player who dealt the damage. All retalliation/rewards goes back to the player who use the cards and not Xiao Qiao. eg: - Ruler attacks Xiao Qiao and she passes damage to Loyalist . Loyalist dies = Ruler discard all cards and equipment. -Ruler attacks Xiao Qiao and she passes to Rebel . Rebel dies =Ruler gains 3 cards rewards. <br /><br />5. Can Xiao Qiao detect /redirect Barbarians/Raining Arrows/Duel?<br /> Ans: Yes and No No: She cannot deflect the effect of these cards unto another player . Meaning she cannot ''deflect'' Barbarians and ask another player to use ATTACK to neutralize the card. Yes: She can deflect the damage she suffers if she DOES NOT neutralize the card. Meaning , if someone uses Barbarians and she chooses not to use  ATTACK ,she sufferes 1 damage . She can transfer the damage to another player . That victim receive the damage straight-up , can no longer use the ATTACK to neutralize the card  because what is transferred is Damage  and not the card effect. <br /><br />6. If Xiao Qiao is challenged with someone who cannot be avoided such as Huang Xhong or Ma Chao , can she deflect the injury?<br /> Ans: Yes. It does not matter if the attack can be avoided. She transfers damage that she receives which mean the attack is already concluded by that point. <br /><br />7. If Xiao Qiao is locked in Iron Shackles and receives the fire damage , does the damage travel through the chains when she uses her power ?<br />  i.e Does she get hurt before she is able to pass the damage and then return to health , or does she never receive the damage at all  ? Ans: Xiao Qiao can only pass the damage on AFTER receiving damage. Thus it is logical to say that the fire attack is channeled to the relevant victims already. <br /><br />8. If Zhang Fei is at 1 health and Xiao Qiao deflects 2 units of damage to Zhang Fei , and Zhang Fei is peached 2 times , woul that mean he is able to draw 5 cards?<br /> Ans: No there is no concept of negative health in SGS. Even for  Zhou Tai , he is considered at zero health regardless of how many death cards he has. Thus the max number of cards to draw would be the max health of the victim, and no more. <br /><br />9. If Xiao Qiao redirect the damage to another shackled player, would the shackled player receive the deflected damage + the transmitted damage from the initial attack?<br />'' Ans: Yes. This unfortunate player would receive both damages. <br /><br />10. Only Da Qiao can enter the ''initial target'' status for Iron Shackling right?<br /> Where as if Xiao Qiao is the initial target, she can't alter the initial target? Ans: Yes, Da Qiao can enter the initial target, Xiao Qiao cannot. <br /><br />11. If I am playing as Xiao Qiao and I am linked with IRON SHACKLES to another player who is the target  of Fire Attack ; can I loop the damage of the fire element back to the original target multiple times as long as I have the hearts cards to play?<br /> Ans: You can deflect the damage you receive that was passed by the shackles. But that will only happen once , because the shackles will be broken. You can deflect infinite number of times , as long as you have the hearts or spades . Just that for the shackles,it breaks after each transmit","link_references":[{"Zhou Yu 周瑜":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/zhou-yu.html"},{"Da Qiao 大乔":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/da-qiao.html"},{"Zhang Fei 张飞":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/zhang-fei.html"},{"LIGHTNING":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/lightning.html"},{"ACEDIA":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/acedia.html"},{"Zhou Yu":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/zhou-yu.html"}],"kingdom":"Wu Characters 吴将"},{"name":"Zhōu Tài 周泰","image_url":"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_cZXVdsBvjyM/THfxjfGa7SI/AAAAAAAAAUE/XTEPhKqV-lY/s200/wuzhoutai.jpg","local_image":"wuzhoutai.jpg","card_url":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/zhou-tai.html","abilities":[{"name":"Character ability: \"Refuting Death 不屈 (bù qū)\"","description":"When Zhou Tai's health reaches zero (brink of death), one playing card must be flipped from the deck and placed on his character card. Zhou Tai is not considered dead at this point and the game continues. Whenever he loses an additional unit of health from here on, an additional card will be further added on top of his character card. As long as none of these cards have the same \"number\" (ie: from ace to king), Zhou Tai will remain alive. Whenever there is a card or more placed on his character card, he will always be considered as being on the \"brink of death\".Disambiguation:1. Can the card displayed after Zhou Tai's health reaches zero be \"tinkered\" with by Si Ma Yi 司马懿 or Zhang Jiao 张角?Ans: No. It is not a judgement card and cannot be changed by these 2 characters.[Added Feb 2011] 2. Can other players use PEACH 桃 on Zhou Tai when he has \"brink-of-death\" cards displayed?Ans: Only under specific circumstances. Other players can only use PEACH on Zhou Tai when:(a) When Zhou Tai receives damage(b) Right after a \"brink-of-death\" card is flipped.3. What happens when another \"brink-of-death\" card has a number that matches one of the other cards already displayed?[Updated Feb 2011] Ans: Zhou Tai DOES NOT die immediately. Instead the other players have the option of using PEACH to save him, or he can use PEACH or WINE 酒. Once saved, the most recent \"brink-of-death\" card can be discarded.[Added Feb 2011] 4. Can Zhou Tai use PEACH or WINE in his turn to remove \"brink-of-death\" cards, even though he did not receive damage?Ans: Yes. 5. What is the largest number of health units that Zhou Tai can have in total before he dies?Ans: 16!! 3 units of health deducted the normal way plus a possible 13 different cards can be displayed without any repeating number."}],"faq_text":"<br /><br />1. How is Peach and  Wine  at the ''brink of death mode'' effective?<br /> Ans: Using PEACH or WINE at the ''brink of death'' mode will let him remove one ''brink of death'' card each. <br /><br />2. Can Zhou Tai keep his on-hand cards if his health is zero?<br /> Ans: No,he cannot keep any on-hand cards whatsoever.He must use all of his cards or discard them all. <br /><br />3.Does Zhou Tai have to remove all equipped cards(like weapons,horses,and armor)when he is on the brink of death?<br /> Ans:No he does not. He can keep all his equipped items. The only penalty for being on the brink is he cannot hold any cards in hand at the end of the turn. <br /><br />4.Does he die immediately when 2 brink-of-death cards have the same suit. Ans:Yes.He dies immediately. <br /><br />5.If Xiao Qiao deflects to Zhou Tai, does he draw brink-of-death cards or Xiao Qiao's ability cards first?<br /><br /> Ans:Xiao Qiao's victim will only draw the cards after every other issue has been concluded.For eg: if a player becomes zero life, the player must be rescued first before drawing the cards. For Zhou Tai's case, the \"death card\" must be flipped first before he can draw the cards from Xiao Qiao's ability. <br /><br />6.When Zhou Tai is on the brink of death can others heal him with peaches on their turns?<br /> Ans: Yes. any player can heal him during their turns.Each heal will remove one of the 'death cards\" from Zhou Tai. <br /><br />7.If Zhou Tai's health is at -5 (5 brinks of death cards),now when Xiao Qiao receives 1 damage and uses her Deflecting damage ability to Zhou Tai (therefore 6 brink of death cards), does he get to draw 10 cards(6 brinks of death cards +  4 health unit)?<br /> Ans:Unfortunately, NO. He can only draw up to maximum 4 cards. Although it appears that he has \"negative health\" but in actual fact his heath just remains at zero and he is being sustained by his ability. Therefore he can only draw up to 4 cards. <br /><br />8.Does anything happens to Zhou Tai's \"death cards\" when his character card is flipped by Cao Pi?<br /> Ans: Nothing happens to his \"death cards\" when he is flipped. His ability still works. The only difference is he skips turn.","link_references":[{"Sun Quan 孙权":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/sun-quan.html"},{"Si Ma Yi 司马懿":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/si-ma-yi.html"},{"Zhang Jiao 张角":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/zhang-jiao.html"},{"PEACH 桃":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/peach.html"},{"PEACH":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/peach.html"},{"WINE 酒":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/wine.html"},{"Sun Quan":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/sun-quan.html"},{"Sun Quan":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/sun-quan.html"}],"kingdom":"Wu Characters 吴将"},{"name":"Sūn Jiān 孙坚","image_url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_cZXVdsBvjyM/TH8VFMZl6TI/AAAAAAAAAX8/6FwiufdWE5s/s200/wusunjian.jpg","local_image":"wusunjian.jpg","card_url":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/09/sun-jian.html","abilities":[{"name":"Character ability: \"Lingering Spirit 英魂 (yīng hún)\"","description":"\nIn the beginning of every turn, Sun Jian can carry out either of the options listed below if he is no longer at maximum health (X represents the number of units of health Sun Jian has lost thus far).

"}],"faq_text":"<br /><br />1. How do we arrange the judgement card exchange ability between Zhang Jiao and Si Ma Yi when they are in play?<br /> Ans: The sequence  in which judgement tinkering works is as follow (according to SGS online game) -Imagine the players turns go anticlockwise from player A to B to C etc..Up to H. Now imagine player B is Si Ma Yi and player H is Zhang Jiao. -Say player A draws a judgement card ,the 1st tinkerer allowed to change the card is player B(Si Ma Yi) ie. following direction of gameplay. After that player H (Zhang Jiao) can change the judgement card that Si Ma Yi  laid down. -Once the ''cycle'' goes back to player A, the tinkering ends. Which means both tinkerers only have ONE CHANCE to change the judgement card , and who changes first is determined by their sequence  in the gameplay. <br /><br />2. Whose ability comes first when Zhang Jiao use Dodge against Pang De's attack?<br /> Ans: Zhang Jiao performs lightning strike BEFORE Pang De gets to discard Zhang Jiao's cards . The reason for this is as follows (based on the chinese instruction on the cards): Zhang Jiao's lightning strike  takes place before the conclusion of the DODGE 闪结算前 whereas Pang De's ability states when an Attack has been DODGED(杀被闪抵消时). Thus it appears that Zhang Jiao's lightning strike take precedence. <br /><br />3.Will Zhang Jiao's ability come into play twice if he uses a dodge card?<br /> Ans: Yes, he can use Lightning Strike TWICE if he uses 2 dodge cards. <br /><br />4. If Zhang Jiao has the Eight Trigrams armor equipped , does that count as a dodge?<br /> Ans: Yes it does. If Ba Gua Zhen judgement is Red, it is equivalent to having used a dodge, and Zhang Jiao can use Lightning Strike with it. <br /><br />5. I know that Zhang Jiao can use his ability to exchange judgement cards, but say he is a victim of Acedia and Rations depleted, since its equipped to him, can he use his ability to use those cardsto exchange the judgement cards?<br /> Ans: Yes he can. For Ration's Depleted 兵粮寸断, the user of judgement needs to open a Clubs to dodge the effects so ''Zhang Jiao 张角'' an use his ability to ''cheat'' the effect. However , for ''Acedia 乐不思蜀 '' the user requires a Hearts to escape the penalties and ''Dark Sorcery  鬼道'' ONLY allows you to change the judgement card into black(Spades or clubs) which makes Zhang Jiao 张角 100% to fail judgement if he changes it. <br /><br />6. If Zhang Jiao is in a state of Rations Depleted ( which means the tool card is equipped to him) and if somebody attacks him, zhang jiao dodges, forces judgement. NOW since Rations Depleted is a dark suit card , and is equipped to him , can he use THAT card to exchange the judgement?<br /> Ans: Time-Delay Tool cards such as ''Acedia 乐不思蜀'' and Lightning 闪电 belongs to no one regardless of its user and position. Reason being Time-Delay  Tool cards are still tool cards just that they stay in play until they take effect (eg. Guan Yu can't possibly use his Red Duel 决斗 card in the middle of a duel as an ''ATTACK 杀'' in the middle of duel if he runs out of ATTACK 杀) However , i may be wrong , so feel free to dispute my claim","link_references":[{"Liu Bei 刘备":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/liu-bei.html"},{"Cao Cao 曹操":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/cao-cao.html"},{"LIGHTNING 闪电":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/lightning.html"},{"Liu Bei 刘备":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/liu-bei.html"}],"kingdom":"Neutral Heroes 群雄"},{"name":"Yú Jí 于吉","image_url":"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_cZXVdsBvjyM/THnnnhnnqoI/AAAAAAAAAWM/92zQeqP7YWE/s200/qunyuji.jpg","local_image":"qunyuji.jpg","card_url":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/yu-ji.html","abilities":[{"name":"Character ability: \"Bewilder 盅惑 (zhōng huò)\"","description":"\nWhenever Yu Ji uses a Basic Card (like ATTACK 杀, PEACH 桃 etc.) or Non-Time-Delay Tool cards (such as DISMANTLE 过河拆桥, NEGATE 无懈可击 etc.), he can verbalize the intended card but play a card faced down on the table.

Will a card be rendered useless or effective if it's true identity is ''heart'' peach but is verbalised as Attack Card?<br /> Ans: The will be rendered useless because it was a bluff. The sequence follows the following order of steps: Step 1 : Authentic or bluff?? Bluff=card rendered useless(regardless of suit),Authentic=Go to step 2 Step 2: Is the authentic card of a heart suit?No=card rendered useless, Yes= card still effective. <br /><br />2. If i used an attack card that was'nt heart, and I said it was an attack, but people doubt it, they will get hit once,but the attack I used will not work anymore?<br /> Ans: Yes that is correct. <br /><br />3. If I use an attack card, and no one guessed it was a bluff, it gets used as an attack card even if it is'nt a heart?<br /> Ans: Yes that is also correct. <br /><br />4. If no one doubted the card, do you have to flip it over after the effect is used?<br /> Ans: This is arguable. A friend of mine plays the online version, and in that version the bluff card is exposed after conclusion of effect. However in our ''real-life'' version, our house rules are a card that was never doubted will never be exposed. his prevents other players from counting probability. I'm calling this one as dependent on house-rules. <br /><br />5. Do we need to specify our ATTACK element if the enemy has Rattan Armor?<br /> Ans: Yes. if the enemy has Rattan Armor, you will need to specify your ATTACK element. If you verbalise a FIRE ATTACK but in reality is a normal attack, it is considered that you lied. <br /><br />6. If he plays a card face down and it is the actual card and Cao Cao is on the field. Cao Cao declared it as a bluff, but since it was wrong would Cao cao take the card since Cao Cao is damaged?<br /> Ans: No Cao Cao cannot take the card that is a fake. The reason is due to Cao Cao's ability description . He can only pick up the card that caused him damage. In Yu Ji's case, it is Yu Ji's ability that caused the damage, and not the fake card. This is identical to 貂蝉 Diao Chan using ''Seed of Animosity 离间'' against Cao Cao , where if Cao Cao suffers damage, he cannot pick up the card that Diao Chan used. <br /><br />7. If the bluff card was fake and suit of heart, and people called it, it is rendered ineffective and the players who called the bluff draw a card or they don't?<br /> Because it is a heart card?'' Ans: As long as it is a fake, the card will be rendered useless once the bluff is called. It does not matter even if it is heart-suit. The players who call your bluff get to draw 1 card each. The heart-suited card ONY works when the card is real. <br /><br />8. If Yu Ji plays Dodge facedown, even though it is real, and it gets doubted, does Yu Ji lose 1 life since his 'dodge' becomes useless, which is unable to dodge the attack?<br />'' Ans: This is correct ONLY IF that dodge is not heart suit. Once any card is under doubt and flipped over, it becomes useless(which in your scenario, the dodge is wasted and Yu Ji needs to use another dodge card to evade the attack) unless the suit of the card is heart, in which case the card is still effective(which in your scenario, if the dodge card flipped over is heart suit, Yu Ji does not need another dodge.) <br /><br />9. If SiMa Yi called his bluff , and it was a real card, and he gets hit, does he still get to take a card from Yu Ji, and is he able to take the bluff card?<br /> Ans: Sima Yi cannot take any card from Yu Ji . The reasin is Yu Ji's ability causes the victim to ''lose a unit health''. It is akin to the victim being stupid enough to guess wrongly, and therefore the damage is due ti his own fault. <br /><br />10. Can Yu Ji bluff time delay cards such as Bing Liang Cun Duan , Le Be Si Shu, lightning etc?<br /> Ans: Nope . Those are the only cards he cannot bluff. <br /><br />11. How does expression of doubt work?<br /> One after the other by turn order, or must everyone give an answer at the same time? Ans: The official way that doubt is expressed is by turn order. The official way goes like this: 1. Yuji plays a card upside down. 2. Player using Yuji asks the player on his right, '' do you doubt this card?'' 3. Reply must be obtained before going to the next player. 4. All players must be asked. <br /><br />12. Can the player that plays Yu Ji doubt his own card?<br /> Ans: No he cannot. <br /><br />13. If Yu Ji 于吉 plays a hearts ''PEACH 桃'' and Cao Cao曹操 doubts it, so the card is revealed. Since the card is true and hearts , Yu Ji gains 1 life. Since the card is true, Cao Cao 曹操 loses 1 life and takes the peach. In this case Cao Cao 曹操 is in a sure win situation?<br /> Coz if Yu Ji 于吉 lies, Cao Cao 曹操 still gain one card. Ans: Cao Cao CANNOT take the Peach card? The reason is Cao Cao loses a unit of health due to Yu Ji's ability. It is not the Peach card that causes him to lose health. Therefore when Cao cao loses health whenever he guesses Yu Ji's cards wrongly he will never pick up any of the cards..","link_references":[{"Sun Quan 孙权":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/sun-quan.html"},{"PEACH 桃":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/peach.html"},{"DISMANTLE 过河拆桥":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/dismantle.html"},{"NEGATE 无懈可击":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/negate-wu-xie-ke-ji.html"}],"kingdom":"Neutral Heroes 群雄"},{"name":"Dǒng Zhuó 董卓","image_url":"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_cZXVdsBvjyM/TH8WQI00Z_I/AAAAAAAAAYE/XYTfEADCgsk/s200/qundongzhuo.jpg","local_image":"qundongzhuo.jpg","card_url":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/09/dong-zhuo.html","abilities":[{"name":"Character ability 1: \"Drown in Wine 酒池 (jiǔ chí)\"","description":"\nDong Zhuo can use any of his on-hand cards with a suit of \"spades\" as WINE 酒.Character ability 2: [Enforced ability] \"Garden of Lust 肉林 (ròu lín)\"\nWhen Dong Zhuo uses ATTACK 杀 on a female character and vice versa, the target character needs to use 2 DODGE 闪 cards to successfully evade the attack.Character ability 3: [Enforced ability] \"Disintegrate 崩坏 (bēng huài)\"\nAt the end of every turn (after discarding his excess on-hand cards), if Dong Zhuo's health is not the least or amongst the least, he must lose 1 unit of health or reduce his maximum health by 1 unit."},{"name":"Character ability 2: [Enforced ability] \"Garden of Lust 肉林 (ròu lín)\"","description":"\nWhen other Heroes 群雄 characters cause any damage to other players, Dong Zhuo can flip a judgement card.

For ability 1, does this mean if Jia Xu attack the RULER who begins with 1 life and drops to 0 , only the RULER can use PEACH to save himself , and that nobody else can use PEACH to save the RULER?<br /> Ans: Yes only the RULER can save himself. It does not even have to be damage caused by Jia Xu . For example , if Jia Xu was a Loyalist and he attacks Zhang Jiao, but Zhang Jiao uses his Lightning strike ability to strike the ruler, whose health reduces to zero , nobody else except Jia Xu can use PEACH to save him. So this can be potentially disastrous if the consequences are not properly thought through. <br /><br />2.

If Jia Xu forces Player A to attack , and both Jia Xu and Player B are equidistant from Player A , who gets to choose who gets hit?<br /> Ans:  The player who is executing the ATTACK gets to choose , which means there is a chance that Jia Xu himself  will be the target of ATTACK from the 2 players on his left and right . <br /><br />3.

Can Jia Xu's tool card be Negated by other player?<br /> Ans: Black negate do have an effect on Jia Xu's tool card. This is because the negate is use on the tool card and not on Jia Xu himself. <br /><br />6. Do barbarian cards has an effect on Jia Xu?<br /> Ans: Both barbarian cards are black, therefore they have no effect on Jia Xu. <br /><br />7.

As the name implies, the action is simple: ATTACK! Use this card to inflict damage on your opponent. The damage will have no elemental attributes to it. Plain ol' knuckle busting.<h4>What it does:</h4>In the simplest sense, using this card is equal to taking one stab/slash/chop/whatever-barbaric-attack-you-prefer at your opponent. Yes only ONE. Of course, your opponent can dodge the attack if he has the DODGE 闪 card.<h4>How to use it:</h4>During your turn, you are allowed to use ATTACK only once. Note that elemental attacks such as LIGHTNING ATTACK 雷杀 and FIRE ATTACK 火杀 count as using an ATTACK card as well. This means you can use only one of three ATTACK cards (ATTACK, LIGHTNING ATTACK or FIRE ATTACK) once in your turn. When using ATTACK, the attack range is critical. ATTACK can only reach the opponent within your attack range. Click here to read more about attack range.There are 3 specific scenarios where ATTACK can be used multiple times to cause multiple consecutive damage. 1. When you have equipped the ZHU GE CROSSBOW 诸葛连弩2. When you have equipped the GREEN DRAGON CRESCENT BLADE 青龙偃月刀3. When your character is Zhang Fei 张飞In scenarios 1 and 3, you can repeatedly use as many ATTACK cards as you fancy on as many opponents as you wish within your attack range (and thus incur the wrath of everyone.

Neh neh ni bu bu~<h4>What it does:</h4>Do you really need me to spell it out for you?! Dodge! Evade! Get out of the way! <h4>How to use it:</h4>When an ATTACK is used on you, use this card to dodge the attack immediately. In 99% of cases, you will not get to use this card during your turn. (Interested to know what is that special 1% scenario? Click here.) In certain cases, ATTACK can be dodged without the use of this card. This happens when you have equipped EIGHT TRIGRAMS 八卦阵 or when you play the role of RULER 主公 using Cao Cao 曹操. Follow the links for more details.<h4>Special abilities:</h4>Probably the only instance when the DODGE card can cause damage to a player is when Zhang Jiao 张角 uses it when he is attacked. Everytime Zhang Jiao uses DODGE, he can choose to use his \"Lightning Bolt 雷击\" attack to inflict 2 units of lightning damage to any player of his choice! Follow the link to read more about Zhang Jiao.Miscellaneous:Against conventional logic, the DODGE card might be the most frustrating card to draw from the deck! The reason is the more DODGE cards you draw, the less options you have in that turn. This happens because you cannot actively use DODGE during your turn since you are not under attack. This problem is compounded when you use a character that has an advantage with less or no cards on hand, such as Elder Zhu Ge Liang 诸葛亮, or Lu Xun 陆逊. Since you cannot choose to discard cards if your number of cards on hand is equal or less than your amount of life points at that moment, you will likely be stuck with DODGE cards at the end of your turn!\n\n","card_type":"Basic Cards 基本牌"},{"name":"Peach 桃 (táo)","image_url":"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_cZXVdsBvjyM/TIYTpNBXfZI/AAAAAAAAAdM/Ph_srfjs0s8/s200/basictao.jpg","local_image":"basictao.jpg","card_url":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/peach.html","link_references":[],"description":"\n<h4>Description:</h4>The life-saver.

Accordingly, victims equipped with RATTAN ARMOUR receive 2 units of damage.<h4>How to use it:</h4>First, use the BLAZE card by tossing it into the discard deck. Next pick the target player you want to use it on. Assuming the player does not use NEGATE 无懈可击, he or she must show you 1 of the cards in his or her hand. Take note of the suit of the card that is shown to you. You can choose to effect 1 unit of fire attribute damage by discarding 1 of your on-hand cards that has the same suit. Therefore, you have expended 2 cards (including the BLAZE card) to cause damage.Some details you should bear in mind:1. The target player does not discard the card shown to you. 2. The target player should not cover up the card and only reveal the suit. The entire card should be visible. (This is arguable and subject to your own house rules)3. The target player should reveal the card to everyone and not just the user of BLAZE. (This is also arguable and subject to house rules)4. BLAZE cannot be used on a player with no more cards on hand.\n\n","card_type":"Tool Cards 锦囊牌"},{"name":"Duress 借刀杀人 (jiè dāo shā rén)","image_url":"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_cZXVdsBvjyM/TIYQsukzvHI/AAAAAAAAAbE/RD6eF8n60Hw/s200/jnjiedao.jpg","local_image":"jnjiedao.jpg","card_url":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/duress.html","link_references":[],"description":"\n<h4>Description:</h4>Out of ATTACK 杀 cards to use? Your target opponent out of range? Want to hold a member of the opposite team hostage? This is the tool card to use.

Note that the intended recipient of the ATTACK must be within attacking range of the player held under DURESS. If the target player refuses to use an ATTACK card, he or she must give up the equipped weapon to the user. The user then keeps the unethically acquired weapon as an on-hand card. The weapon can also be equipped immediately.<h4>How to use it:</h4>First determine the target to be held under DURESS. This player must have a weapon equipped.

The phrase \"killing 2 birds with 1 stone\" is taken to the extreme with the IRON SHACKLES card. Use this card to shackle players together, then watch them all fry when any 1 of them receives Fire attribute or Lightning attribute damage. Technically, you can shackle every goddamned mofo that is in play if you have enough of this card. What benefit would that bring, you ask? Well, read on to find out!Assuming you have no wish to shackle people together, then you can choose to use \"RE-DRAW 重铸\" to exchange for another card from the deck.<h4>What it does:</h4>This card shackles together 2 players of the user's choice. In order to differentiate the players that have been shackled from those that haven't, the character card (the one with the character name such as \"Liu Bei 刘备\" etc.) of those who have been shackled will be placed in the \"landscape\" orientation instead of the usual \"portrait\" orientation. When any 1 of the players shackled receives either fire or lightning damage, all the shackled players receive the same amount of damage of that element. Note that damage (not an attack or a tool card effect)  is transmitted, therefore the incoming transmitted damage cannot be avoided by DODGE 闪 or NEGATE 无懈可击.  However the damage can be deflected if you are using the appropriate character (such as Xiao Qiao 小乔). All shackles are broken immediately after any elemental damage has been transmitted. Shackles can be broken between 2 players by using another IRON SHACKLES card or using the NEGATE 无懈可击 card.As there have been many questions regarding IRON SHACKLES, a separate section has been dedicated to the disambiguation of this card in the \"Disambiguation\" section below. By choosing to execute RE-DRAW instead of IRON SHACKLES, you get a 1-for-1 exchange immediately by drawing a new card from the deck.<h4>How to use it:</h4>To shackle: Pick 2 players to be shackled. Toss the IRON SHACKLES card into the discard pile. Have these 2 players place their character cards from portrait to landscape orientation.To unshackle: Pick 2 players that have already been shackled. Toss the IRON SHACKLES card into the discard pile. Have these 2 players revert their character cards back to the portrait orientation. To use RE-DRAW: Toss this card into the discard pile and redraw another card from the deck. No players will be shackled in doing so. Note that RE-DRAW is not considered \"using\" this tool card, therefore Huang Yue Ying 黄月英 cannot draw an additional card (2 cards) when executing RE-DRAW.Disambiguation (FAQ) according to Yoka games FAQ in chinese:1. If more than 1 IRON SHACKLE card was used to shackle 2 different pairs of players, does it matter which pair of players were shackled for damage transmission and unshackling? For example there are 4 players A, B, C and D. A was shackled with B, and C was shackled with D. If A receives fire damage, will C and D also receive damage? What about unshackling? Must we unshackle only the pairs A-B or C-D? Can we unshackle A-C or B-D?Ans: There are only 2 status of players: those that are shackled and those that are not. All players that are victims of IRON SHACKLES belong to the shackled status. When fire or lightning damage is received, all players that are in the shackled status will receive damage as well. It does matter specifically whom was shackled with whom. Therefore to answer the scenario listed above, when A receives fire damage, all 4 players A, B, C and D will receive fire damage since all are in the shackled status. Similarly, any 2 players in the shackled status can be unshackled. Therefore the pairs A-C or B-D can be unshackled.2. If player A has equipped RATTAN ARMOUR 藤甲 and received fire damage, will all shackled players receive 2 units of damage? Or does player A receive 2 units of damage only?Ans: All shackled players receive 2 units of damage since the shackles transmit the same elemental damage and the same magnitude as was received by the victim. 3. What if player A has equipped RATTAN ARMOUR and is shackled with player B (who does not have RATTAN ARMOUR equipped), and this time player B receives 1 unit of fire damage?Ans: Player B receives 1 unit of fire damage while player A receives 2 unit of fire damage. This is because the element and magnitude being transmitted to all is solely determined by the victim (player B). Thus everyone shackled receives 1 unit of fire damage. Player A first receives 1 unit of fire damage, then the damage is increased up to 2 units only for player A because of the RATTAN ARMOUR equipped. 4. Assume player A has SILVER HELMET equipped, and is shackled to player B who does not have any armour equipped. If player B is struck by LIGHTNING 闪电, will player A receive 3 units of damage or only 1?Ans: Player B receives 3 units of damage while player A receives only 1 unit. However if player A was the one struck by LIGHTNING, all players shackled receive only 1 unit of damage. The logic is similar to question 3.Shackling yourself to another player:Now why in the world would you want to do something as crazy as making yourself victim to shackling? Here are two scenarios for you to consider. 1. If you are playing the role of REBEL 反贼 and there is a LIGHTNING out there in play, it can be a pretty good idea to shackle yourself to the RULER 主公. Here's why. Whenever the LIGHTNING reaches you, the LOYALIST 忠臣 would not want the RULER to suffer 3 units of lightning damage if you get struck! There is a chance the LOYALIST may NEGATE the LIGHTNING for you at your turn, just so as to protect the RULER. Loophole here is that it only works on beginners. The expert players will use their NEGATE to unshackle you and the RULER just before you render judgement for LIGHTNING. But either way, you waste one of their NEGATE cards.2. This 2nd scenario involves protecting yourself from Zhang Jiao 张角 and his Lightning Bolt attack (2 units of lightning damage if Zhang Jiao uses DODGE and judgement is \"spades\"). By shackling yourself to him, he would not use Lightning Bolt against you since he would also receive 2 units of damage.

Though this is usually seen as a defensive tool card, expert players know how to use this card as an offensive against certain characters. Read on to find out more!<h4>What it does:</h4>When this card is played, cards from the deck are flipped around for every player to see. Flip open as many cards as there are players still in play (5 players still alive, flip 5 cards). The player who used HARVEST gets to choose which card he or she wants first. This is followed by the player after him or her, and so on until the final card is taken by the player whose turn was just before the user.

One option that works is to use NEGATE to deny an opponent a chance to pick up a card. Toss in NEGATE when its your opponent's turn and there is a chance he or she will pick up DODGE. This way your teammates may have picked up ATTACK and your opponent will be one DODGE short.The other option is to force a player to take a card, and by doing so it puts that player in a disadvantage. For example, a player using Elder Zhu Ge Liang 暮年诸葛亮 is impervious to ATTACK and DUEL when he or she has no cards on hand (the \"Empty City 空城\" ability). Using HARVEST forces the player to pick up a card, thus the Empty City ability is not longer in effect. \n\n","card_type":"Tool Cards 锦囊牌"},{"name":"Negate 无懈可击 (wú xiè kě jī)","image_url":"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_cZXVdsBvjyM/TIYQ3BNoAUI/AAAAAAAAAcE/6oZnlnI0eBs/s200/jnwuxie.jpg","local_image":"jnwuxie.jpg","card_url":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/07/negate-wu-xie-ke-ji.html","link_references":[],"description":"\n<h4>Description:</h4>The all-important card!

Be very afraid. When LIGHTNING appears, either a particular player has become desperate and suicidal, or the \"judgement tinkerers\" Si Ma Yi 司马懿 and Zhang Jiao 张角 have reared their ugly head. Typical exclaimations by players when LIGHTNING is used range from \"Oh maaaaaaan~\" to \"Oh f******k~\" to \"WAH LAO EH~!\" Strangely, more often than not the player who activates the LIGHTNING card ends up regretting it.<h4>What it does:</h4>\nThree units of lightning attribute damage! During the \"judgement phase\", if the judgement card happens to fall between 2 to 9 of \"spades\", you get struck by lightning. Immediately lose 3 units of health. \nHere's the messed up part: If you happened to be shackled by IRON SHACKLES 铁索连环, every player that is also shackled will also lose 3 units of health since lightning damage can be transmitted!\nHere's the super messed up part: The \"judgement tinkerers\" Si Ma Yi and Zhang Jiao can manipulate the outcome of judgements. Thus when either of these 2 characters are around, they can literally control who gets struck by lightning! \"Oh maaaaaaan~\"\nHere's the insanely messed up part: LIGHTNING does not go away despite not striking the player or using NEGATE 无懈可击. The LIGHTNING card simply moves on to the subsequent player, and the next, and the next, until somebody eventually gets hit! There are only 2 ways to get rid of LIGHTNING without it striking a player. Either use DISMANTLE 过河拆桥 or STEAL 顺手牵羊. Russian roulette anyone?\nIf you're a total sadist and you love seeing everyone cower in fear, use another LIGHTNING card while the first LIGHTNING card is still making its rounds. That way 2 consecutive judgements need to be made. But don't release your evil laugh just yet! The first player who needs to make 2 consecutive judgements would be you! If you are in luck and both LIGHTNING cards strike you, that's 6 units of health gone! Who's the one laughing then?<h4>How to use it:</h4> \nLIGHTNING is the only card where you can inflict serious hurt on yourself first before anyone else. This is because to use it, you must first place it in front of YOUR OWN equipped-items cards. Therefore the first judgement of LIGHTNING happens in the next turn of the player who used it. If the judgement card does not fall between 2 to 9 of \"spades\", the card moves on to the subsequent player. It keeps moving until someone gets struck or someone uses DISMANTLE or STEAL on it.\nTake note that if you wish to use NEGATE to avoid getting struck, the NEGATE card has to be used before the judgement card is flipped.\nPerhaps \"LIGHTNING-Proof\" is not completely accurate since all of the characters mentioned below are never completely immune to getting struck, but they definitely stand a much much better chance of surviving a LIGHTNING strike or evading it altogether.\n1. Younger Zhu Ge Liang 卧龙诸葛亮 - all black-suit cards (\"clubs\" and \"spades\") can be used to NEGATE before judgement.\n2. Elder Zhu Ge Liang 暮年诸葛亮 - His \"Star-Gazing\" ability is used before the judgement phase, therefore he can swop the judgement card as he wish.\n3. Si Ma Yi 司马懿 - He can use any cards on hand to manipulate the judgement card after it as been revealed.\n4. Zhang Jiao 张角 - Same as Si Ma Yi 司马懿 except he can only use \"clubs\" and \"spades\" for manipulation. \n5. Xiao Qiao 小乔 - She is completely lightning-proof since all her \"spade\" cards will be viewed as \"hearts\". Thus even if the judgement card falls between 2 to 9 of spades, to her it will be 2 to 9 of hearts! No strike!\nKnow other \"LIGHTNING-Proof\" characters?

For all 3 players to evade successfully, a total of 6 DODGE cards would be been used up! The more likely scenario is all 3 players suffer damage because chances are, they would not be holding 2 DODGES on hand.

The ROCK CLEAVING AXE may undoubtedly be a fantastic weapon in the card game, but it is raising a lot of questions about how its original owner is in the Romance of Three Kingdoms story. So far, the two most likely heroes that may have used this axe are Xu Huang 徐晃 and Xu Chu 许褚. As this weapon does not seem to bring any special advantage to any particular character, I'm tempted to say that this weapon did not actually exist in the story at all. Game maker says \"Hey we need an axe as a weapon card. Don't all RPGs have an axe? Let's just give it some ancient sounding name like 贯石斧.\"<h4>Attacking range:</h4> 3<h4>Special ability:</h4>When your ATTACK 杀 has been evaded, you can choose to discard any 2 cards (on-hand or equipped) and force the relevant damage back on to the targeted player. You should realize that by doing so, you are effectively using up 3 cards (1 ATTACK and 2 discarded) just to force that damage, so it better be worth it!<h4>Disambiguation:</h4>Let me be honest and say that I did not translate the chinese instructions for the special ability literally. That is because the literal translation is \"when your ATTACK has been neutralized (抵消)...\" Now everyones inference of ATTACK getting neutralized varies. Some say it has to be DODGED, others say a deflection such as Da Qiao 大乔's \"Displacement 流离\" counts, while others say to \"neutralize\" requires the ATTACK to be rendered ineffective. I have chosen to replace \"neutralized\" with \"evaded\", which should disambiguate things a little. As long as the ATTACK was meant for a player, but he or she did not receive damage as a result of the ATTACK, that would be considered as being evaded. Therefore,- DODGE is considered evaded- Da Qiao's \"Displacement\" ability is considered evadedBut Xiao Qiao 小乔's \"Heavenly Scent 天香\" ability is NOT considered evaded since that only deflects the damage already received, and not the ATTACK itself.<h4>Characters that match this weapon best:</h4>Xu Chu is a relatively good match since his \"Bare-Chested 裸衣\" ability allows him to deal 2 units of damage. To allow your opponent to evade that ATTACK is going too easy on him. However I still feel the ROCK CLEAVING AXE  is useful to any character. Perhaps you have an opinion that I would love to hear.

A search on the ownership of this blade in the story turned up nothing, which adds to my guess that this weapon was created purely for this card game.

The paradox to this is FROST BLADE only has an attacking range of 2, while Huang Zhong needs a weapon with as large an attacking range as possible to evoke his \"Fearsome Archer 烈弓\" ability.

Definitely a huge asset to Huang Zhong! A number one priority for DISMANTLE 过河拆桥 if you are in the opposing team!\nYou may know of the Qi Lin by it's other name, Kirin in Japanese culture. Although the Qi Lin is a mythical being, it was once used to refer to giraffes back in ancient China. In fact, I visited Malacca in Malaysia and saw a bust of a giraffe with the words 麒麟 used to describe it. It was with reference to a Zheng He 郑和 exhibit, a historical explorer in the 14th Century.

The SERPENT HALBERD is Zhang Fei 张飞's weapon and it supposedly has a wavey lance-like shaft. Whether it is a spear or a halberd remains debatable. The direct translation for 矛 is \"spear\" and not halberd, but the very extensive translation of the story by C.H. Brewitt-Taylor calls it a \"halberd\". It is unlikely that Brewitt-Taylor would get \"spear\" and \"halberd\" mixed up as there are thousands more insanely difficult chinese characters which was precisely translated. In the card game, this weapon is mildly popular for its special ability and range. It probably is not as heavily desired because it is not lethal enough (unlike the ZHU GE CROSSBOW 诸葛连弩). Nonetheless, the above average attacking range helps, whether or not you use its ability.<h4>Attacking range:</h4> 3<h4>Special ability:</h4>You can choose to use ATTACK 杀 by discarding any 2 on-hand cards. <h4>Characters that match this weapon best:</h4>Although this is Zhang Fei's weapon, I have to say that it benefits him in this card game only under certain conditions. The key reason for this is the fact that Zhang Fei will seldom have the chance to hold more than 6 cards in his hand. If Zhang Fei needs to use his \"Barrage 咆哮\" ability but has no ATTACK cards on hand, the SERPENT HALBERD will allow him to unleash 3 consecutively ATTACKs if he does have 6 on-hand cards. It may be enough to win, but I still think it is too big a cost. On the other hand, this weapon will not benefit Card-hoarders like Lu Meng 吕蒙 very much because they are unable to consecutively unleash ATTACKs (only Zhang Fei can do this with his \"Barrage\" ability). So it satisfies neither parties fully. What a pity.\"Colour\" of the ATTACK produced:\nThe colour of the ATTACK matters when used against Ren Wang Shield 仁王盾. \"Red\" cards here refer to cards with heart or diamond suit. \"Black\" cards refer to spades or clubs.\n- If 2 red cards are used - The attack is RED\n- If 2 black cards are used - The attack is BLACK\n- If 1 red and 1 black card is used - The attack is \"colourless\".\n\n","card_type":"Weapons 武器"},{"name":"Zhu Ge Crossbow 诸葛连弩 (zhū gě lián nǔ)","image_url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_cZXVdsBvjyM/TIYU8CCunEI/AAAAAAAAAek/W5oC1puNqds/s200/weaponzhuge.jpg","local_image":"weaponzhuge.jpg","card_url":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/zhu-ge-crossbow-zhu-ge-lian-nu.html","link_references":[],"description":"\n<h4>Description:</h4>The game-changer.

Lu Meng is always a freaking time-bomb waiting to go off, and the ZHU GE CROSSBOW is just the spark it needs to ignite the blast. My personal experience playing in a game of 8 players is Lu Meng keeping quiet with almost 20 on-hand cards. Once he draws this weapon from the deck, he unleashes a string of over 12 consecutive ATTACK cards. Wiping out the player on his left first, then going straight for the RULER 主公 two places to his left. Despite a bunch of DODGE 闪 and PEACH 桃 cards that temporarily saved the RULER, the sheer number of ATTACKs blasted away whatever defense and rescue the RULER and LOYALISTS 忠臣 had. The round was 45 minutes in without much drama, then it was all over within 2 minutes in the hands of Lu Meng.

Today, this horse is endangered and can only be found in the Turkmenistan and Russian regions.To read more about the Da Yuan region and its geographical information, click here to go to its Wiki.\n\n","card_type":"Horses 马"},{"name":"Dí Lú 的卢","image_url":"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_cZXVdsBvjyM/TIYWzsRiB0I/AAAAAAAAAfk/edHqxZShHnI/s200/horsedilu.jpg","local_image":"horsedilu.jpg","card_url":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/di-lu.html","link_references":[],"description":"\n<h4>Owner:</h4>Liu Bei 刘备<h4>Description:</h4>You could not possibly read Romance of Three Kingdoms and not come across this horse. That is because if not for Di Lu, Liu Bei would have died early on in the story. Liu Bei first came across this horse whilst he was under the service of Liu Biao 刘表. The enemy, Zhang Wu 张武, was sitting atop this beautiful steed and both Liu Bei and Liu Biao admired it from opposite the front line. Zhao Yun 赵云 quickly understood Liu Bei's unspoken desire to have the horse and said to Liu Bei, \"Give me three rounds\". Indeed within 3 rounds, Zhao Yun killed Zhang Wu and brought Di Lu over to Liu Bei. Liu Bei wanted to honor Liu Biao and presented Di Lu to him as a gift, however Liu Biao's advisor hastily discouraged accepting the gift. The advisor claims that the dark recesses under Di Lu's eyes and the spots on its face symbolized a cursed horse that would bring death to its rider. Liu Biao declined the horse and advised Liu Bei not to ride it too, but Liu Bei ignored the superstitions.Later in the story, Cai Mao 蔡帽 usurped power after Liu Biao's death and planned to ambush Liu Bei. Liu Bei got wind of the plan and hastily escaped with Di Lu, but found no way across a creek several meters wide. He decided to take a gamble and hop over the creek on Di Lu, but Di Lu stumbled into the creek and got stuck in the mud. Cai Mao was fast approaching and it seems all was lost. Liu Bei said to Di Lu, \"Di Lu! Di Lu! Alas, you bring my death as was foretold!\" Suddenly Di Lu gave one huge leap and jumped over 10 meters (exaggerated i'm sure) to bring Liu Bei to safety. From that day on, Liu Bei treated Di Lu with utmost care and love.But the story does not end there. Years later, Liu Bei would lend Di Lu to Pang Tong 庞统 in their invasion of Luo Cheng 雒城. An enemy ambush mistook Pang Tong as Liu Bei since he was riding atop Di Lu and killed him at Luo Feng Po 落凤坡. Di Lu went missing and was never mentioned after that. \n\n","card_type":"Horses 马"},{"name":"Huá Liú 骅骝","image_url":"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_cZXVdsBvjyM/TIYW08lRFtI/AAAAAAAAAfs/_8oIrG7Pcas/s200/horsehualiu.jpg","local_image":"horsehualiu.jpg","card_url":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/hua-liu.html","link_references":[],"description":"\n<h4>Owner:</h4>Not applicable<h4>Description:</h4>Similar to Da Yuan 大宛, Hua Liu is not a specific horse in the story but a superb breed.

It is consistently mentioned in historical records and writings from the Qin Dynasty 秦朝 (before three kingdoms era), Tang Dynasty 唐朝 (after three kingdoms era), Song Dynasty 宋朝, to the most recent Qing Dynasty 清朝. Hua Liu does not appear to have been mentioned specifically in the story, but its lineage would probably have been widely known by the time the three kingdoms era begun. \n\n","card_type":"Horses 马"},{"name":"The Shadow 绝影 (jué yǐng)","image_url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_cZXVdsBvjyM/TIYW2H22Q-I/AAAAAAAAAf0/i1qkr5eUAw4/s200/horsejueying.jpg","local_image":"horsejueying.jpg","card_url":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/shadow-jue-ying.html","link_references":[],"description":"\n<h4>Owner:</h4>Cao Cao 曹操<h4>Description:</h4>This horse supposedly runs so fast even its own shadow cannot keep up with it. I was extremely tempted to translate its name as \"Shadowfax\", the name of Gandalf's horse in \"Lord of the Rings\", but decided not to so as not to cause any confusion between this two stories. The Shadow accompanied Cao Cao during his early days and was said to be with him since the Yellow Turban Rebellion.The Shadow became a focal point in the story during the battle of Wan Cheng 宛城之战, where Cao Cao suffered the terrible loss of his bodyguard Dian Wei 典韦. During Cao Cao's escape from Zhang Xiu 张绣's ambush, The Shadow carried its master through a rain of arrows. Cao Cao was said to survive only because of the speed of this horse. Thought to be one of the Da Yuan horses 大宛马, The Shadow suffered 3 arrow wounds to its body but kept going. It was only after an arrow pierced its eye did it ultimately fall in that battle.In the battle of Wan Cheng, Cao Cao lost his horse (The Shadow), his bodyguard (Dian Wei), one of his sons Cao Ang 曹昂, and his nephew Cao An Min 曹安民.\n\n","card_type":"Horses 马"},{"name":"Zhuǎ Huáng Fēi Diàn 爪黄飞电","image_url":"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_cZXVdsBvjyM/TIYW3evkuuI/AAAAAAAAAf8/R8Q9vSYItbg/s200/horsezhuahuang.jpg","local_image":"horsezhuahuang.jpg","card_url":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/zhua-huang-fei-dian.html","link_references":[],"description":"\n<h4>Owner:</h4>Cao Cao 曹操<h4>Description:</h4>Neither the literal translation nor the actual chinese words put together make much sense. Loosely translated, it says \"Yellow Claws, Flying Lightning\", where \"yellow claws\" is referring to its yellow hooves. The way the 4 words are put together is awkward, but I guess that is the way it was meant to be. Zhua Huang Fei Dian is Cao Cao's ceremonial horse. It has a body that is white as snow with 4 yellow hooves. An awe-inspiring outlook and a unique name makes it the perfect steed for large events and ceremonies. Cao Cao does not ride this horse into battle. Zhua Huang Fei Dian has very little mention in the story, but where it was mentioned was a significant part of the story. Cao Cao rode this horse for a hunting excursion with the young Emperor of Han. The entire imperial cabinet came along for the hunt. By this time, Cao Cao has already put the Emperor under his \"protection\" and is starting to show signs of playing the puppet-master. A deer appears and the young Emperor let fly 3 arrows, but they all missed. Cao Cao volunteers to shoot the deer down, but he picks up the Imperial Bow and loads an Imperial Golden Arrow (nobody else can use these except the Emperor himself). With one shot, Cao Cao kills the deer.  The imperial cabinet, seeing the golden arrow but not able to see who shot it, thought the Emperor got his prey and shouted \"Long Live the Emperor!\". But when Cao Cao came into view holding the Imperial Bow, everyone's faces turned ashen grey. It was the moment it became crystal clear, that Cao Cao's intention was to grasp the Imperial power for himself. \n\n","card_type":"Horses 马"},{"name":"Zǐ Xīng 紫骍","image_url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_cZXVdsBvjyM/TIYW4zODJxI/AAAAAAAAAgE/umgGk5QWudk/s200/horsezixin.jpg","local_image":"horsezixin.jpg","card_url":"http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.com/2010/08/zi-xing.html","link_references":[],"description":"\n<h4>Owner:</h4>Cao Zhi 曹植 (son of Cao Cao 曹操, younger brother of Cao Pi 曹丕)<h4>Description:</h4>I must confess to finding little about Zi Xing. All that my research has thrown up is it is of the Da Yuan 大宛 breed of horses and is fast as lightning. The word 骍 is already extinct in the common chinese dictionary. It refers to a cross-breed between a bull and a horse with a reddish body. However it is pretty clear that Zi Xing is but a name borrowing on the strength of the Xing breed, when it truly is a Da Yuan breed. Zi Xing belonged to Cao Zhi, the drunken poet famous for his \"7 Step Poem 七步诗\". The life and struggles of Cao Zhi can be made for a dramatic novel all by itself. The pinnacle of Cao Zhi's melodramatic life came when Cao Pi wanted Cao Zhi executed for being too drunk to attend their father Cao Cao's funeral. Cao Zhi was challenged to come up with a poem within 7 walking steps or die. That was when Cao Zhi cited his 7 Step Poem, that moved Cao Pi to tears.Since this write-up is not about Cao Zhi, you can read more about him here on this Wiki link.\n\n","card_type":"Horses 马"}]}}
